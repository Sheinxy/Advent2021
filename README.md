## Personnal Feedback

### Day 1:
I am quite proud of my solution, I'm obviously just trying to show off here but it's fun. When I look back at my first solution last year, I feel like I've progressed quite a lot!

### Day 2:
This one was easy, I am kind of disappointed that I couldn't do showy one-liners for the move and moveAndAim functions (I mean, I could with inline if-else I guess)
