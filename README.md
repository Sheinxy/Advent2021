## Personnal Feedback

### Day 1:
I am quite proud of my solution, I'm obviously just trying to show off here but it's fun. When I look back at my first solution last year, I feel like I've progressed quite a lot!

### Day 2:
This one was easy, I am kind of disappointed that I couldn't do showy one-liners for the move function (I mean, I could with inline if-else I guess)

### Day 3:
Okay this one was kind of a mess, the first part is pretty okay (I probably could have done something more optimised, but it works just fine), however I am totally unsatisfied by my second part. I think there has to be a way in Haskell to do what I want

### Day 4:
Well, it may not be the most optimised, like I have to traverse the grid twice because I'm too lazy to do things better, but it works, it's readable and all, so yeah I'm kind of satisfied, oddly enough

### Day 5:
This one was easy and pretty straightforward, I'm happy with my solution. I just wish I could mix both parts into one but I can't

### Day 6:
This one was really fun. Of course I first I did the most naive solution, but then when I went onto part 2 I had to do a smarter one. Of course mine is still not that smart, because I can't modify an element of a list in-place I just decided to do a silly workaround, but it works and it's fine considering the size of the array

### Day 7:
Okay I am really disappointed in myself for that one. I feel like there's a much better way of doing part 2, but I can't find it for now. I'm going to think a little bit more about it. Edit: Ok I am more satisfied now

### Day 8:
THIS ONE WAS INCREDIBLY FUN! I am actually quite happy with my solution. Although some would find it ugly and whatnot, I believe it is actually a good solution as it manages to be both simple to understand (basically the only weird thing to understand is the head . filter thingies, because I didn't want to use find because it didn't make sense to have Maybe here in my opinion)

### Day 9:
I came prepared with Data.Matrix ;D. I was waiting to use that one, and here it is! Also, I think I did a fricking DFS using foldl, didn't I?

### Day 10:
This one was really easy. Too easy in fact, it was kind of boring :C I mean, it's just matching parenthesis all over again in the end

### Day 11:
I was really scared about cellular automaton in Haskell because I had a very bad experience last year. Turns out this year I am rolling over them quite easily, good innit?
