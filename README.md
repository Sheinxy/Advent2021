## Personnal Feedback

### Day 1:
I am quite proud of my solution, I'm obviously just trying to show off here but it's fun. When I look back at my first solution last year, I feel like I've progressed quite a lot!

### Day 2:
This one was easy, I am kind of disappointed that I couldn't do showy one-liners for the move function (I mean, I could with inline if-else I guess)

### Day 3:
Okay this one was kind of a mess, the first part is pretty okay (I probably could have done something more optimised, but it works just fine), however I am totally unsatisfied by my second part. I think there has to be a way in Haskell to do what I want

### Day 4:
Well, it may not be the most optimised, like I have to traverse the grid twice because I'm too lazy to do things better, but it works, it's readable and all, so yeah I'm kind of satisfied, oddly enough

### Day 5:
This one was easy and pretty straightforward, I'm happy with my solution. I just wish I could mix both parts into one but I can't
